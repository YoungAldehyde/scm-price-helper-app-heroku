# Steam Community Market Price Helper Web app deployed on Heroku

The deployed web app is live at this [link](https://scm-price-helper.herokuapp.com/)

This web app gets price and volume data of a virtual item traded on [Steam Community Market](https://steamcommunity.com/market/), and generates hourly level time-series charts for price and volume separately. 

This app also features **Export to Excel** function, which lets users download hourly-level [Steam Community Market](https://steamcommunity.com/market/) price and volume data in CSV format, which is not available on [Steam Community Market](https://steamcommunity.com/market/).

More features to be added in future, such as
- Decomposition of time series trends into Seasonal and cyclical patterns
- Price Forecast
- etc.
